# ABAP for Dummies

This training is a part of the *iXP Tech Tranings*.

## Pre requisites

It would be very nice to have at least a little knowledge on

- programming logic
- SAP GUI

Also, for a better experience a working connection to a development abap system would be good. We recommend QHR.005 which is the one we will use.

For day two, as it is focused on already technical people, it is interesting to have the following topics inside your brain:

- [clean code with abap](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md)
- [solid principles](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/GS-HCM-SLE/solid-principles/O/)
